# Bus-and-Passenger-Prediction-for-Port-Authority
 - Collaborated with team members to predict the number of passengers and the number of buses for the Port Authority of NY and NJ.
- We have consolidated more than 100 (125-150) datasets into one and we explored the data for missing values.
- Then, we identified the historical trends for the number of passengers and buses and projected those trends into the future using PowerBI, up until we arrived at the numbers and dates required by the Port Authority.
- The next step was to build a model with additional factors that might affect passenger numbers such as gas prices, temperatures, sporting events, and others.
- The goal was to improve the predictive ability of the time series data we initially received.
- Passenger departure values are predicted up to December 2030. They are expected to surpass 125k weekly departures in March 2025. By the end of 2030, the weekly passenger departures are expected to be around 255815.
- Bus departure values are predicted up to December 2030. They are expected to surpass 3.9k weekly departures in October 2030.
- Our group was the winner of this competition among the other groups in our course and the ranking was done by the organization.
